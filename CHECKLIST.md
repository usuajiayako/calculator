## Planning
[check] Copy this list into your project
[check] Outline functionality of your app
[check] Draw what the user will see
[check] Break out components from your sketch
[ ] Name your components
[ ] Draw component hierarchy
[ ] Label where you will require functions that change state
[ ] Label where you will require data
[ ] Determine from this where you will require state & hold functions

## Setup
[check] Create your app directory (e.g. with create-react-app)
[check] Run your app
[check] Ensure you have React DevTools running (in browser)
[check] Make blank components (functional or class?) as per your plan
[ ] Export and import components as per your hierarchy
[ ] Check everything is hooked up

## Further functionality
[ ] Flesh out your components with methods - this is a pretty big step!

## Style
[ ] Add classNames
[ ] Create and import .css file(s)
